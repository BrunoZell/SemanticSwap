# ETHDenver '23 BUIDL Submission: SemanticHack

A coordination scheme to organize an awesome hackathon experience. It is building on SemanticSwap, a unique framwork of value that unlocks digital-native social coordination.

While SemanticSwap is capable of modelling any domain and any value system while keeping the architecture static, for the hackathon we focussed on a single coordination scheme: Experiencing a great hackathon.

## Coordination Schemes

A coordination scheme gives structure to social coordination. It defines asks, offers, and jobs. Such a scheme describes who is doing what, when, in order to accomplish what.

Each coordination scheme is domain specific. Here's usefil analogy that helps to think about coordination schemes:

_Coordination schemes are to SemanticSwap what companies are to money._

Where _money_ and _SemanticSwap_ are frameworks of tought. They help to structure ideas in order to shape reality the way we want (which is, to get stuff done).

## Value Proposition

For our _SemanticHack_ coordination scheme, we focus on follwing value propositions that we expect will make a great hackathon experience for all participants:

- Have a place to hack
- Have a stable internet connection
- Have a good supply of food and drinks
- Have a solid teammate matching mechanism
- Have space to brainstorm project ideas
- Have ability to approach experts and mentors to resolve technical questions
- Have a matchmaking mechanism between builders and investors
- Easily find people to have lunch, dinner, drinks with
- Ride sharing to get around the city and hop between event locations and hack houses

## Focus: Matchmake teammates

Ask:

```ieml
"My project needs
A: Software Development in {Solidity, Vyper, JavaScript, Rust, Scala, F#, [freetext]}
B: UI/UX development with {Figma, Adobe sth, MS Paint}
C: Project management
D: {Interested|Proficient|Expert} in {zero knowledge, fully homomorphic, IEML, HGTP, Ethereum, Solana, IPFS}"

Offer:

```ieml
"I can do
A: Software Development in {Solidity, Vyper, JavaScript, Rust, Scala, F#, [freetext]}
B: UI/UX development with {Figma, Adobe sth, MS Paint}
C: Project management
D: {Interested|Proficient|Expert} in {zero knowledge, fully homomorphic, IEML, HGTP, Ethereum, Solana, IPFS}"
```

Market maker: Sends virtual offers to "My project needs" asks based on similar "I can do" asks.

Jobs:
- Look through all asks and offers and matchmake. Increasingly categorizing offers to automate matchmaking.
- Maintain list of definitions of technologies. By building an ontology. They just propose it and people are free to use whatever. What should emerge are the most useful defintions (altough they might not be exactly correct).
